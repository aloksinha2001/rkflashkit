rkflashkit
===


rkflashkit is an open sourced (GPL v2) toolkit for flashing Linux kernel images (Picuntu) to rk3066/rk3188 based devices. It's programmed with python and gtk2. The kernel program is adapted from Galland's rkflashtool_rk3066 which is in turn based on cyteen's rk3066-rkflashtool.

rkflashkit talks to the devices through vpelletier's python-libusb1 which is a python wrapper of libusb. For convenience the python-libusb1 programs are included in rkflashkit. Also included is binary created for Ubuntu.
